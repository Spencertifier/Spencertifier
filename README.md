  - Reverse Engineer and Repackage Existing Solutions That Meet the Feature Needs
  - Merge the Repackaged Solutions Together to Fill in the Feature Gaps for the 1040 Map Project
  - Find the Features that Do Not Exist that I will Have to Create From the Ground Up.
  - Repeat the Above Process
     - For Features that do not exist
     - 1. break The Features down into smaller parts (features of the feature)
       2. Do market validation to see if these sub features exist
       3. reverse engineer existing sub-features
       4. merge the reverse engineered repackaged resources together
       5. find the sub features that do not exist.
       6. Repeat the process, or write the code myself for the sub features.
       7. Merge all the subfeatures and features together, and ship the 1040 map project.
