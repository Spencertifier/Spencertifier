# üëã Hello, I'm 1040Conquest

Passionate technologist aiming to make GO solutions that mobilize a generation to take action in bringing peace to the ends of the Earth. 

## üöÄ Current Projects (More in R&D coming soon)

[WE-GO APP - Gamifying Boots on the Ground Work for Gen-Z]

Currently working on an app, modelled after fortnite, to encourage the younger generation to GO and engage their community, empowering them to pair found suffering with solutions that bring peace. Giving them a clear target, training, tools, tracking, and teaming all within the app to empower them to reach their target TOGETHER! 

[1040 War Room - Solutions to encourage people to make War Room's that declare war on suffering to the ends of the earth]

ZipCode Map Target + Tracking: Currently working on a solution that creates 7foot x 5foot zipcode maps. These maps can be placed in ones room. The software lets the user strategically break the zipcode into regions with 1040 homes (digital or physical regional tracking maps), then breaks those regional maps down into sections of 40 houses each. The sections are then added to a printable map template that labels each section map from A-Z (Example A-40 to Z-40 for a total of 1040 houses). The user can then print the section maps and go reach the 40 houses and keep track of their progress. 50 section maps work for 50 teams of 2 to go out and reach 40 houses each in one day. It takes about 1 hour for a team of 2 to reach 10 homes if they are fruitful. This project has been tested, and it successfully allowed for 66 teams of 2 to reach 1298 homes in the Month of Decemeber 2023.
Tools + Training (+ Resources): I have learned how to take tools and trainings that have proven successful and convert them into poster form that can also be hung on the wall next to the map allowing the War Room leader to have a clear plan on what they will be equipping their teammates to bring to each house to properly bring peace to the home.
Teaming Map: I've created a teaming map that is a smaller version of the zipcode map that shows the teams that are partnering to reach the zipcode target together. This helps there to be clear communication between the regional teams, and keep track of all the teams of 2 that are working with each regional leader.  

## üèîÔ∏è Fun Fact

Once conquered the seemingly impossible hill, "Mount Baldy" in New Mexico, rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of rolling mountains for what seemed to be 111 miles.

## üéØ Long-Term Goals

Creating solutions that mobilize a generation to alleviate suffering and meet every person and place with the solutions that bring peace on earth.
