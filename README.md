## 🚀 Current Projects

[Gamifying Boots on the Ground Work for Gen-Z]

Currently working on an app to mobilize boots on the ground laborers to locate and pair suffering people with solutions to alleviate their suffering. The app UI is designed after Fortnite to encourage a movement of Gen-Z soldiers to go out and make a difference in this world by giving them UI they are already familiar with. 

[War Room Global]

Currently working on a solution that creates 7foot x 5foot zipcode maps, lets the user strategically break the zipcode into 1000 home regions, then breaks those regions down into sections of 40 houses each. Once the software has helped the user chart out the 40 house sections, it turns those sections into printable section maps. 50 section maps work for 50 teams of 2 to go out and reach 40 houses each in one day. It takes about 1 hour for a team of 2 to reach 10 homes if they are fruitful. This solution is a mass outreach solution allowing teams to go out and pair every person and place with the solutions that alleviate suffering in their community. This is the paper simplified version of the Gamified Version.  

## 🏔️ Fun Fact

Once conquered the seemingly impossible hill, "Mount Baldy" in New Mexico, rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of rolling mountains for what seemed to be 111 miles.

## 🎯 Long-Term Goals

Creating solutions that mobilize a generation to alleviate suffering and meet every person and place with the solutions in their best interest.
